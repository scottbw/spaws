#Actor

Actors are users who are the creators of the paradata - so writers of reviews and givers of ratings.

Actors have two properties:

* displayName: the user name as typically displayed in the source system, whether thats a handle/userid or full name.
* url: the url for the user in the source system, such as their profile page.


## Example

        "actor": {
            "displayName": "John Smith",
            "url": "http://my-store.com/profiles/234"
        },
